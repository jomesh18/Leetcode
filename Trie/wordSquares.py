'''
Word Squares
Description

Given a set of words without duplicates, find all word squares you can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

b a l l

a r e a

l e a d

l a d y

    There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
    All words will have the exact same length.
    Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
    Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.

Example

Example 1:

Input:

["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]

Output:

[["wall","area","lead","lady"],["ball","area","lead","lady"]]



Explanation:

The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

Example 2:

Input:

["abat","baba","atan","atal"]

Output:

 [["baba","abat","baba","atan"],["baba","abat","baba","atal"]
