Hint
Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.
Example 2:

Input: root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
