Hint
Given a binary string s and an integer k, return true if every binary code of length k is a substring of s. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "00110110", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10" and "11". They can be all found as substrings at indices 0, 1, 3 and 2 respectively.
Example 2:

Input: s = "0110", k = 1
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 1 are "0" and "1", it is clear that both exist as a substring. 
Example 3:

Input: s = "0110", k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The binary code "00" is of length 2 and does not exist in the array.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
1 <= k <= 20

    def hasAllCodes(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        if k > len(s): return False

        for i in range(k):
            curr <<= 1
            if s[i] == '1':
                curr |= 1
        nums[curr] = True
        for i in range(k, len(s)):
            curr <<= 1
            if curr & (1<<k):
                curr ^= (1<<k)
            if s[i] == '1':
                curr |= 1
            nums[curr] = True

        found = True
        for i in range((1<<k)):
            if not nums[i]:
                found = False
                break
        return found
