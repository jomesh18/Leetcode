Description

Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter, for example: "abc" -> "bcd". We can keep "shifting" which forms the sequence:

"abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"

Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.

You don't need to care about the order of the result.
Example

Example 1:

input:["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"]

output: [["a","z"],["abc","bcd","xyz"],["acef"],["az","ba"]]

Example 2:

input:["a"]

output:[["a"]]
